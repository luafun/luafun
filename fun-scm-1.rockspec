Lua Fun is a high-performance functional programming library for Lua
designed with LuaJIT's trace compiler in mind.

Lua Fun provides a set of more than 50 programming primitives typically
found in languages like Standard ML, Haskell, Erlang, JavaScript, Python and
even Lisp. High-order functions such as map, filter, reduce, zip, etc.,
make it easy to write simple and efficient functional code.
